# Destiny 2 Fishing Bot
This bot is created to aid the player in automatic fishing at a fishing pond with perfect catches. A small amount of image recognition is used to tell when the user has a catch.

This is created using python, pip packages required can be found in src/requirements.txt

Currently, there is a requirement you are using a 1920x1080 monitor with the game running in fullscreen/windowed fullscreen mode to use the small amount of image recognition on the correct pixels. 

This will be changed in the future to allow for any resolution, either using audio cues or more likely a different method of setting up image recognition.
